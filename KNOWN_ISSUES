MPAM branch snapshot: v5.1+

This snapshot exists to give the full context for any x86 resctrl changes.

MPAM spec:
https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0598/latest


KNOWN ISSUES:
* The ACPI table has an alpha status, and the definition of PPTT has changed
  in the meantime. All the table parsing code needs to be re-written once there
  is a new version of the spec.

* This branch has only been tested on the FVP model, which doesn't do anything
  with the MPAM configuration values. Testing focussed on cpuhp and lockdep.

* MB: This doesn't probe succesfully on the model, and I haven't found any
  x86 hardware that has the feature, so that code has never run.

* rdt_resources sharing the same mpam_class. Because its likely that the MBA
  resource and the last-level-cache rdt_resources are backed by the same
  class/component, mpam_resctrl.c either needs to cope with multiple
  configurations for a partid, or split the mpam/resctrl structs apart
  completely.

* NULL pointer dereference in __rdtgroup_cbm_overlaps() somewhere around
  "x86/resctrl: Stop rdt_cdp_peer_get() referencing CODE/DATA enums directly".
  Unable to reproduce.

* Double list_add() in __check_limbo() on
  "x86/resctrl: Remove the CODE/DATA illusionary caches". Haven't spotted
  it yet.
