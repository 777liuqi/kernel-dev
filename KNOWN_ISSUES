MPAM branch snapshot: v5.1+

This snapshot exists to give the full context for any x86 resctrl changes.

MPAM spec:
https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0598/latest


KNOWN ISSUES:
* The ACPI table has an alpha status, and the definition of PPTT has changed
  in the meantime. All the table parsing code needs to be re-written once there
  is a new version of the spec.

* This branch has only been tested on the FVP model, which doesn't do anything
  with the MPAM configuration values. Testing focussed on cpuhp and lockdep.

* MB: This doesn't probe succesfully on the model, and I haven't found any
  x86 hardware that has the feature, so that code has never run.

* NULL pointer dereference in __rdtgroup_cbm_overlaps() somewhere around
  "x86/resctrl: Stop rdt_cdp_peer_get() referencing CODE/DATA enums directly".
  Unable to reproduce.

* Double list_add() in __check_limbo() on
  "x86/resctrl: Remove the CODE/DATA illusionary caches". Haven't spotted
  it yet.

 * The model doesn't suport the performance-counters, so the monitor code has
   never run. resctrl calls the arch code via IPI, but MPAM's NRDY bit means
   we have to be able to sleep in there. This is currently known-broken.

 * Exclusive reservations don't work as they overlap with devices.
   This in turn is because we don't have GIC/SMMU support yet, and these
   will continue to use partid=0.

 * partid=0 should be reserved for the unknown hardware, but we let user-space
   play with it. This also affects the kernel, which is not (currently) the
   intention.
